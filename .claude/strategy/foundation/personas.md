## David - The Efficiency Seeker

**Archetype**: Multi-client tech freelancer who maximizes billable hours

**Demographics**:
- Location: Madrid, Barcelona (works with international clients)
- Age: 28-42
- Profession: Developer, designer, consultant
- Revenue: €60K-120K/year
- Clients: 3-8 active clients, mix of Spanish and international
- Daily rate: ~€225 average (€253 Madrid, €258 Barcelona)

### Research Validation

**Where we found David:**
- Active on Forocoches threads ("Programa para autónomo de facturación electrónica 2025")
- GitHub discussions and open-source invoicing projects
- LinkedIn tech communities
- Trustpilot/Capterra reviews complaining about Holded bloat

**Key quote from research:**
> "For a freelance designer, you'd use only 5% of what you pay for" — Holded review

### Current Situation

**Tools Today**:
- Excel/Google Sheets for invoicing (being forced to migrate by Verifactu)
- Traditional gestoría (€100-150/month) — frustrated by cost for simple needs
- Mix of bank accounts for currencies
- Manual expense tracking
- Some use Holded/Quipu but find them bloated or expensive

**Monthly Workflow**:
1. Create invoices in Excel (2-3 hours)
2. Convert currencies manually (error-prone)
3. Calculate VAT for different jurisdictions (confusion about ROI, form 349)
4. Send PDFs via email
5. Forward everything to gestoría
6. Chase late payments manually

**Time Spent**: 6-8 hours/month on invoicing admin

**International Client Complexity** (validated pain point):
- Issuing invoices with Spanish VAT when it doesn't apply
- Not registering in ROI (Intra-Community Operators Registry)
- Forgetting form 349 submission deadlines
- DUA document confusion for exports outside EU
- Payment terms vary by country (Spain: 60 days)

### Jobs to Be Done

| Job Type | Job Statement |
|----------|---------------|
| **Functional** | Invoice international clients correctly without currency/VAT errors |
| **Social** | Appear professional to clients with polished invoices |
| **Emotional** | Feel confident I'm compliant; reclaim weekends for life |

### Pains (Research-Validated)

| Pain | Severity | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Holded/Quipu bloat | High | "Using 5% of features I pay for" — Trustpilot |
| International VAT complexity | High | ROI, form 349, DUA errors common — InfoAutónomos |
| Gestoría costs for simple needs | High | €100-150/month for quarterly filing frustration |
| Multi-currency conversion | High | Manual errors compound tax filing issues |
| Verifactu uncertainty | High | 82% of SMEs not ready for deadline |
| Poor software support | High | "Customer service nearly nonexistent" — Holded reviews |

### Gains

| Gain | Importance |
|------|------------|
| Automated multi-currency invoicing with VAT rules | Critical |
| Time back for billable work (6+ hours/month) | Critical |
| Verifactu compliance without thinking | High |
| Lower gestoría dependency (or smarter collaboration) | High |
| Professional invoice appearance | Medium |
| ROI/form 349 automation | Medium |

### Buying Triggers

- Verifactu deadline approaching (July 2027)
- New international client with complex VAT requirements
- Gestoría raises prices or provides slow responses
- Lost weekend to invoicing mess-up or Excel error
- Friend/colleague recommends a solution
- Trustpilot research leads to Holded frustration

### Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "My Excel system works fine" | Verifactu makes Excel/Word illegal for B2B invoicing from July 2027. Fines up to €50,000. |
| "I don't want to learn new software" | 5-minute setup. If you can use Slack, you can use Invoo. Faster than Excel by day 2. |
| "Will my gestoría accept it?" | They get real-time dashboard access — less work for them, faster answers for you. |
| "Holded/Quipu already work" | You're paying for CRM, inventory, and HR modules you'll never use. We do invoicing only. |

### Messaging That Resonates

- ✅ "Reclaim 6 hours/month for billable work"
- ✅ "Multi-currency invoicing with automatic VAT by country"
- ✅ "Verifactu compliance built-in — forget about it"
- ✅ "Your gestoría sees everything in real-time — no more email ping-pong"
- ❌ "Simple invoicing" (he doesn't want simple, he wants powerful but focused)
- ❌ "Cheap" (he values time over money)
- ❌ "All-in-one solution" (that's what he's escaping)

## Carmen - The Simplicity Seeker

**Archetype**: Local service provider who wants professional invoicing without tech headaches

**Demographics**:
- Location: Valencia, Madrid, secondary cities
- Age: 38-55
- Profession: Consultant, therapist, trainer, designer, illustrator, small retailer
- Revenue: €25K-50K/year
- Clients: 15-30 local businesses/individuals

### Research Validation

**Where we found Carmen:**
- InfoAutónomos blog comments and guides
- LinkedIn articles about autónomo challenges
- Rankia forums asking basic tax questions
- Still downloading "Plantillas de facturación en Excel" from InfoAutónomos

**Key quote from research:**
> "No está de más contar con un gestor de confianza al que consultar" — InfoAutónomos

**Critical insight**: Carmen wants her gestoría INVOLVED, not replaced. Technology anxiety is real.

### Current Situation

**Tools Today**:
- Word templates (8+ years old) — WILL BECOME ILLEGAL under Verifactu
- Paper expense receipts in shoebox
- Traditional gestoría (€60-100/month)
- Manual everything

**Monthly Workflow**:
1. Open Word template, update client name
2. Calculate taxes with calculator (error-prone)
3. Save as PDF, email to client
4. Collect expense receipts in folder
5. Weekend trip to gestoría with papers
6. Wait for gestoría to confirm everything's OK

**Time Spent**: 4-6 hours/month + significant anxiety

**Verifactu Forcing Function** (critical insight):
- From July 2027, Word/Excel invoices are ILLEGAL for B2B
- Carmen doesn't know this yet — denial phase
- When she learns, high anxiety and urgent need
- Fines up to €50,000 for non-compliance

### Sub-Segment: Creative Professionals

**Unique characteristics:**
- Designers, illustrators, artists
- Complex VAT rules: 21% standard, 10% for art sales, 0% for copyright transfers
- Must reference copyright transfer explicitly on invoices
- IRPF: 15% standard, 7% for new autónomos
- Deductible: software subscriptions, coworking, art supplies, courses

**Additional pain**: Confusion between copyright transfer (sin IVA) vs. design services (con IVA)

### Jobs to Be Done

| Job Type | Job Statement |
|----------|---------------|
| **Functional** | Create correct invoices without manual calculations |
| **Social** | Look professional to clients despite not being "tech-savvy" |
| **Emotional** | Feel safe that Hacienda won't come after me |

### Pains (Research-Validated)

| Pain | Severity | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Verifactu fear and confusion | Critical | 82% not ready, 38% will delay until last minute |
| Technology anxiety | High | "I'm not good with technology" — common objection |
| Manual tax calculations | High | Calculator errors, fear of Hacienda |
| Word/Excel becoming illegal | Critical | Must migrate, no choice |
| Gestoría coordination delays | Medium | #1 reason autónomos switch gestorías is "lack of communication" |
| Expense receipt chaos | High | Shoebox system doesn't scale |

### Gains

| Gain | Importance |
|------|------------|
| Dead-simple interface (simpler than Word) | Critical |
| Automatic tax calculations (impossible to make mistakes) | Critical |
| Verifactu compliance without understanding it | Critical |
| Professional appearance | High |
| Gestoría still involved (trust preserved) | Critical |
| No weekend paperwork | Medium |

### Buying Triggers

- Gestoría warns about Verifactu deadline
- Invoice rejected by client for compliance issues
- Tax calculation error caught by Hacienda
- Friend's daughter sets up "easy" software for her
- Gestoría raises prices or becomes unresponsive
- Reads article: "Por qué tu plantilla de Word no funcionará en 2027"

### Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I'm not good with technology" | If you can use WhatsApp, you can use Invoo. We designed it for people like you. |
| "My Word system has worked for 8 years" | Verifactu makes Word invoices illegal from July 2027. Fines up to €50,000. |
| "What if I make a mistake?" | Impossible — we calculate IVA and IRPF automatically. You just enter the amount. |
| "I don't want to lose my gestoría" | They're already connected and see everything in real-time. Less trips, faster answers. |
| "Software is expensive" | €10.90/month — less than one hour of your work. Your gestoría dashboard is included free. |

### Messaging That Resonates

- ✅ "Más fácil que Word, legalmente compliant"
- ✅ "Tu gestoría ya está conectada"
- ✅ "Cálculos automáticos — imposible equivocarse"
- ✅ "Verifactu sin complicaciones"
- ✅ "Si usas WhatsApp, puedes usar Invoo"
- ❌ "Powerful features" (scares her)
- ❌ "Automate everything" (sounds complex)
- ❌ "Replace your gestoría" (she wants them involved)

## Miguel - The Focus Seeker

**Archetype**: Single-client developer who wants minimal overhead while staying compliant

**Demographics**:
- Location: Remote (anywhere in Spain)
- Age: 25-38
- Profession: Developer, contractor
- Revenue: €50K-70K/year
- Clients: 1 main client (90%+ revenue) + occasional side projects

### Research Validation

**Validation level**: Moderate — exists but less active in communities

**Key insight**: Miguel has a latent legal anxiety about "falso autónomo" classification that we didn't fully capture.

**TRADE vs Falso Autónomo concern**:
- TRADE (legal): >75% income from one client, but autónomo controls how/when work is done
- Falso Autónomo (illegal): Client controls schedule, location, means of production
- Penalties: Up to 6 years prison for both autónomo and client
- Miguel lives in this gray zone and worries about it

### Current Situation

**Tools Today**:
- Excel with one recurring template
- Basic gestoría (€50-70/month)
- Manual PDF sending
- Minimal expense tracking

**Monthly Workflow**:
1. Duplicate last month's invoice in Excel
2. Update date
3. Send PDF to same client
4. Occasional weekend project = manual new invoice (breaks system)
5. Quarterly gestoría check-in

**Time Spent**: 1-2 hours/month (but anxiety about scaling and legal status)

### Jobs to Be Done

| Job Type | Job Statement |
|----------|---------------|
| **Functional** | Send the same invoice monthly with zero friction |
| **Social** | Maintain professional relationship with main client |
| **Emotional** | Know I can scale if side projects grow; feel legally protected |

### Pains

| Pain | Severity | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Paying gestoría €50-70/month for 1 invoice | High | Feels like overpaying |
| TRADE/falso autónomo legal anxiety | Medium | Lives in gray zone |
| Side projects break simple system | Medium | Excel doesn't scale |
| Verifactu uncertainty | Medium | "Will deal with it later" mentality |

### Gains

| Gain | Importance |
|------|------------|
| Recurring invoice automation (set and forget) | Critical |
| Scales without complexity when needed | Critical |
| Verifactu compliance | High |
| Lower costs than gestoría | High |
| Legal peace of mind (proper documentation) | Medium |

### Buying Triggers

- Side project becomes regular client
- Gestoría seems expensive for simple needs
- Verifactu deadline
- Main client asks for invoice format changes
- Reads about falso autónomo penalties

### Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I only send one invoice/month" | Set it up once, we send it automatically. Zero monthly effort. |
| "My system is fine" | Until you get a second regular client. Or Verifactu kicks in. |
| "Gestoría handles everything" | You're paying €70/month for 1 invoice. We're €10.90 with gestoría dashboard included. |

### Messaging That Resonates

- ✅ "Set up once, send automatically every month"
- ✅ "Scales when you do — no system changes needed"
- ✅ "Stop overpaying your gestoría for simple invoicing"
- ❌ "Multi-client management" (not his problem yet)
- ❌ "Complex automation" (overkill)

- ¿Vale la pena una gestoría si solo tienes un cliente?

### Priority Note

**Miguel is LOWER PRIORITY than David and Carmen because:**
- Smaller segment, less active in communities
- Lower engagement and advocacy potential
- High churn risk (may outgrow us or return to gestoría-only)
- Serve him with core product, but don't over-index messaging

## Ana - The Scale Seeker

**Archetype**: Gestoría owner managing hundreds of clients facing digital disruption

**Demographics**:
- Location: Valencia, regional cities
- Age: 45-60
- Business: Family gestoría, 15-30 years established
- Clients: 150-400 autónomos
- Revenue: €100K-300K/year from client fees (€40-120/client/month)
- Team: 2-5 employees (78.5% of gestorías have <10 employees)

### Research Validation

**Market context** (validated):
- 82,000+ advisory/gestoría companies in Spain
- €28+ billion annual revenue across sector
- 300,000+ employees
- Majority have 2 or fewer employees (very small operations)
- 44.6% generate €150,000-500,000 annually

**Key threat identified:**
> "Traditional gestorías working manually are becoming obsolete" — Industry analysis

### Current Situation

**Tools Today**:
- Legacy software: Wolters Kluwer a3ASESOR or Sage (expensive, outdated UI)
- Client Excel files received via email
- Paper expense sorting
- Manual PDF generation
- WhatsApp for client communication (chaotic)

**Software Pain Points** (research-validated):
- **a3ASESOR**: "High cost, outdated screen design, rigid and structured"
- **Sage**: "Expensive, no feature development in 3 years, maintenance doesn't solve problems"
- Both require significant training and are not suitable for small/medium gestorías

**Monthly Workflow**:
1. Receive client invoices (Excel, photos, paper) — no standardization
2. Manually input into tax software
3. Sort paper expenses
4. Generate tax filings
5. Chase clients for missing documents (endless WhatsApp)
6. Answer same questions repeatedly

**Time Spent**: Overwhelmed — clients take 2-3x more time than they should

### Competitive Threat (Critical)

**Online gestorías pricing:**
- TaxDown: From €30/month
- Infoautonomos: €24.95/month
- Solo-Autónomos: €20/month
- Mi Gestoría Online: €29.95/month

**Ana's pricing**: €80-150/month

**Result**: 60-70% price disadvantage vs. online competitors. Must justify value through advisory, not just compliance.

### Why Ana's Clients Leave (Research-Validated)

| Reason | Frequency | Quote |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Lack of communication** | #1 | "Gestoría not proactive, slow responses, having to insist too much" |
| **Poor service quality** | #2 | "No proactive advice on grants, deductions" |
| **Pricing issues** | #3 | "Dissatisfaction with cost vs value" |
| **Limited consultations** | #4 | "Some only allow a few questions per month" |

### Jobs to Be Done

| Job Type | Job Statement |
|----------|---------------|
| **Functional** | Process 300 clients without hiring more staff |
| **Social** | Offer modern solutions to retain clients vs. online competitors |
| **Emotional** | Secure my business's future in a digital world |

### Pains (Research-Validated)

| Pain | Severity | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Manual data entry from client Excel files | Critical | "Proceso consume mucho tiempo" |
| Online competitors (TaxDown, etc.) | Critical | 60-70% price disadvantage |
| Verifactu multi-NIF implementation | Critical | Must implement for 300+ clients simultaneously |
| Legacy software costs (a3/Sage) | High | "Extremely expensive for small firms" |
| Client document chasing | High | Endless WhatsApp messages |
| Staff training on new tools | Medium | "Avoid change" mentality |
| No client self-service portal | High | Competitors offer 24/7 digital access |

### Gains

| Gain | Importance |
|------|------------|
| Automatic client data flow (they invoice, I see it) | Critical |
| Bulk operations across clients | Critical |
| Modern offering to compete with online tools | Critical |
| White-label option (my brand, not vendor's) | High |
| Multi-NIF Verifactu management | Critical |
| Reduced client support burden | High |
| Affordable pricing (not a3/Sage costs) | High |

### What Ana Wishes She Had (Research-Validated)

1. **Affordable Multi-Client SaaS Platform**
   - Not enterprise pricing (a3/Sage too expensive)
   - Not single-user consumer tools (Holded/Billin don't scale)
   - Sweet spot: €200-400/month for 150-400 clients

2. **White-Label Client Portal**
   - Clients create invoices themselves
   - Ana sees everything in real-time on dashboard
   - Branded with her gestoría name
   - Clients feel empowered; she maintains oversight

3. **Verifactu Multi-NIF Management**
   - One-click register all client NIFs
   - Automated AEAT submission per client
   - Audit trail and compliance reports
   - No manual credential management for 300 clients

4. **Proactive Client Communication**
   - Automated reminders for quarterly deadlines
   - Notifications when clients upload docs
   - Built-in messaging (not WhatsApp chaos)
   - Client self-service FAQs

### Buying Triggers

- Losing clients to TaxDown or online competitors
- Verifactu deadline forcing modernization across all clients
- Key employee leaving (knowledge loss, no systems)
- Client asking "why can't I do this online?"
- Competitor gestoría offering "portal access"
- a3/Sage price increase

### Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "My clients won't use software" | We designed for Carmen — simpler than sending WhatsApp photos. |
| "I don't want to lose client relationships" | You're MORE valuable — advising instead of data entry. |
| "Implementation will disrupt my business" | Gradual migration. You control the pace. Start with 10 clients. |
| "What if clients leave once they have software?" | They stay BECAUSE of software + your expertise. That's the winning combo. |
| "I already have a3/Sage" | We're not replacing your accounting software. We handle invoicing so you get clean data automatically. |

### Messaging That Resonates

- ✅ "Tus clientes facturan, tú lo ves todo al instante"
- ✅ "Compite con TaxDown sin perder la relación personal"
- ✅ "Gestiona 3x más clientes sin contratar"
- ✅ "Verifactu para todos tus clientes, resuelto"
- ✅ "Portal con tu marca — ellos usan Invoo, ven tu nombre"
- ❌ "Replace your gestoría" (we're her ally)
- ❌ "DIY invoicing" (threatens her model)
- ❌ "Accounting software" (she has a3/Sage for that)

**Monthly Workflow**:

2. Laura consolidates at end of month
3. Chase missing invoices from team members
4. Forward everything to gestoría via email
5. Gestoría asks for missing documents
6. Quarterly tax prep = stressful scramble

**Time Spent**: 8-12 hours/month on invoicing coordination + significant stress

### What Makes Laura Different from Freelancers

| Aspect | Freelancer (David/Carmen) | PYME (Laura) |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Invoice creators** | Just themselves | 2-4 team members |
| **Visibility need** | Personal records | Who invoiced what, when |

| "Mi equipo no usará otro software" | Si saben usar WhatsApp, saben usar Invoo. Más fácil que Excel. |

## Persona Priority Matrix

| Carmen | Medium (€10.90/mo) | Medium (trust needed) | High (largest segment, forced migration) | Very Strong | **High** |
| Miguel | Low (€10.90/mo) | Low (SEO) | Low (may churn) | Moderate | **Medium** |

---

## Competitive Positioning Summary

Based on research, here's how we differentiate:

| Competitor Pain | Invoo Response | Proof Point |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Holded: Too expensive, feature bloat | Invoicing-only, no CRM/inventory | "€10.90 vs €29+ and you use 100% of features" |
| Quipu/Contasimple: Security issues | Banking-grade security, 2FA | "No hacked accounts, ever" |
| All: Poor customer support | Fast, human support included | "Respuestas en horas, no semanas" |
| Billin: No international invoicing | Multi-currency with auto VAT rules | "Invoice London clients correctly" |
| All: Gestoría as afterthought | Gestoría dashboard included free | "Tu asesor ve todo en tiempo real" |
| All: Verifactu implementation issues | Compliance built-in, tested | "Verifactu desde día 1, cero problemas" |

## Usage Guidelines

### For Content Creation
- Check persona before writing — who is the primary reader?
- Use their language and address their specific, validated pains
- Match tech comfort level to content complexity
- Reference research quotes for authenticity

### For Landing Pages
- Homepage should resonate with David + Carmen (highest volume, SEO)
- Dedicated `/freelancers` page for David + Carmen (individual autónomos)
- Dedicated `/pymes` page for Laura (team invoicing, control angle)
- Dedicated `/gestorias` page for Ana (different buyer journey)
- Pricing page must address "Holded is too expensive" objection

### For Product Decisions
- **Carmen = simplicity filter**: If she can't use it in 5 minutes, simplify
- **David = power filter**: If he finds it limiting for international clients, add depth
- **Laura = team filter**: If it doesn't give visibility across users, add dashboard features
- **Ana = scale filter**: If it doesn't work for 300 clients, rethink architecture

### For Sales/Support
- David: Speak tech, focus on time savings and international features
- Carmen: Speak simply, emphasize gestoría connection and "impossible to make mistakes"
- Miguel: Quick setup, recurring automation, scale-when-ready messaging
- Laura: Team visibility, fast setup, no ERP complexity, gestoría for whole team
- Ana: ROI focus, competitive positioning vs. online gestorías, implementation support
