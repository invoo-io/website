From July 2026, all freelancers must use approved software that generates invoices with QR code and sends information to AEAT in real-time. Invoo is 100% Verifactu compliant."

      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How do I share invoices with my gestoría?",
        "answer": "Your gestoría gets free access to a dashboard where they see all your invoices and expenses in real-time. You don't need to send PDFs by email or chase documents. Invite your gestoría once, and from then on everything syncs automatically."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How long does it take to create my first invoice?",
        "answer": "Less than 2 minutes including initial registration. Once your tax profile and first client are configured, subsequent invoices take 30 seconds."

We'll notify you in-app when we switch to production AEAT endpoints. If you wait until the last minute (like 38-40% of the self-employed, per surveys), you might face rushed adaptation costs; consider testing Invoo now for a smooth transition."

            "question": "Does VeriFactu mean invoices are \"approved\" instantly by AEAT?",
            "answer": "No. Your invoice includes the QR and is submitted to AEAT, but acceptance depends on them. You can track the status and correct it if needed (e.g., rectifications)."

            "question": "What are the penalties for non-compliance with VeriFactu?",
            "answer": "Up to €50,000 for not using approved software or tampering with records. Avoid it with Invoo, which ensures traceability. If preferring alternatives, check they're AEAT-certified, but Invoo integrates directly, reducing operational risks."

          "q7": {
            "question": "Can I still use Excel or Word for invoicing?",

      "title": "Born from Real Experience",
      "description": "When we moved to Spain, we quickly discovered the maze that freelancers navigate daily — endless invoicing, scattered expenses, and complex tax obligations. Every autónomo we met shared the same story: hours lost to paperwork that should take minutes.\nMeanwhile, gestorías told us their side: outdated Excel files, manual data entry, and constant back-and-forth with clients just to get basic information.\nThen Verifactu arrived — a regulatory change that could've made things worse. Instead, we saw opportunity. The perfect moment to build something better.\nThat's how Invoo was born: a platform that speaks both languages — the simplicity freelancers need and the comprehensive data gestorías require. Less time on paperwork, more time on what matters."

Gestoría dashboards that update in real-time.\nNo more \"can you resend that invoice from March?\" No more Sunday afternoons lost to Excel. Just smooth, simple, compliant invoicing that everyone can trust."

The use of Invoo, including automated submission of Invoicing Records, does not exempt the User from the duty to review their invoices or verify the correct filing of their tax obligations.\n\nThe User must maintain adequate copies of their tax documentation and, when acting through a gestoría, verify that it has the necessary information to carry out its work.

They will be responsible for damages generated by negligent use, lack of custody of their keys, or access made under their credentials.\n\nFinally, the User declares that they have the necessary authorizations to enter personal data of third parties on the Platform, complying with corresponding information obligations and keeping Invoo harmless from any claim that third parties may make in relation to such data."

        "q1": {
          "question": "How much income tax does a freelancer pay?",
          "answer": "It depends on your net income. With €30,000 net income and no special deductions, income tax is around €4,500-5,500 (effective rate ~15-18%). With dependent children or over 65, you pay less thanks to the minimums."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What are difficult-to-justify expenses?",
          "answer": "An automatic 5% deduction on net income (max €2,000/year) for freelancers in simplified direct estimation. Covers minor expenses without invoices. No need to justify them. Important: this deduction is incompatible with the reduction for economically dependent self-employed workers (TRADE)."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What expenses can I deduct as a freelancer?",
          "answer": "Deductible items include: social security quota, office rent, proportional utilities, materials and tools, training, insurance, accounting, advertising, business travel, meal allowances, and other business-related expenses."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What is the personal and family minimum?",
          "answer": "It's the portion of income exempt from taxation to cover basic needs. Personal minimum is €5,550 (€6,700 if 65+, €8,100 if 75+). For each child, between €2,400 and €4,500 is added."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "When should I use the 7% invoice withholding rate?",
          "answer": "The 7% rate is for new freelancers (registration year + following 2). If you expect low income, 7% may be enough. If you expect high income, 15% might be better to avoid paying a lot in your tax return."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "What's the difference between normal and simplified direct estimation?",
          "answer": "Simplified is for income < €600,000, allows basic accounting, and automatically deducts 5% of difficult-to-justify expenses. Normal requires full accounting but allows specific bad debt provisions."

          "answer": "With €30,000 annual billing and typical expenses of €3,000, an established freelancer would have a net salary of approximately €17,000-19,000 annually (~€1,500/month). A new freelancer with Flat Rate could reach €20,000-21,000 net thanks to quota savings."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "How is a freelancer's net salary calculated?",
          "answer": "Net salary = Billing - Deductible expenses - Freelancer quota - Income tax. First, subtract expenses from your billing to get net income. Then pay the freelancer quota based on your bracket. Finally, income tax is calculated on what's left minus personal deductions."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What percentage of my billing goes to taxes?",
          "answer": "It depends on your income, but typically 30% to 45% of gross billing goes to taxes and contributions. For low billing (< €20,000), the percentage may be lower (25-35%). For high income (> €60,000), it can exceed 45%."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Is it worth increasing expenses to pay less tax?",
          "answer": "Only if they're real and necessary expenses for your activity. Every euro of deductible expense saves you between €0.19 and €0.47 in income tax (depending on your bracket). It doesn't make sense to spend €100 to save €25 in taxes. But you should ensure you include all legitimate expenses."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "How much do I save with the Flat Rate?",
          "answer": "The Flat Rate lets you pay only €80/month for the first 12 months (extendable to 24 if income is low). If your normal quota would be €300/month, you save €220/month × 12 = €2,640 the first year. It's significant savings for those starting out."

          "answer": "It depends on your sector, experience, and net salary goal. A junior developer might charge €30-50/h, while a senior can exceed €80-100/h.

        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Why does my hourly rate need to be so high?",
          "answer": "As a freelancer, out of every euro you bill, you only take home 50-70 cents net... And no, it's not that you're charging too much: it's that being self-employed costs a lot. The rest goes to income tax (19-47%), social security (~€300-500/month), deductible expenses (20-40%), and non-billable time (vacation, administration, sales). That's why your hourly rate must be 2-3 times your desired 'hourly salary'."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "How many billable hours does a freelancer have per year?",
          "answer": "Typically between 1,200-1,600 hours annually. If you work 40h/week × 48 weeks (minus 4 vacation) = 1,920 total hours. But of those, 20-40% goes to non-billable tasks: administration, client acquisition, training, internal meetings. That's why 1,400-1,500 actual billable hours is common."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Should I include VAT in my hourly rate?",
          "answer": "No. VAT (generally 21%) is added to the final price but isn't your income—you must give it to the tax authorities. Your hourly rate should cover: your net salary + income tax + social security + expenses. VAT is separate and neutral (you collect it from clients and pay it to authorities, though you can deduct VAT from your expenses)."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "How do deductible expenses affect my rate?",
          "answer": "Expenses reduce your tax base, so you pay less income tax and social security. If you spend 20% of billing on deductible expenses, your tax burden will be lower than if you spend 0%. But be careful: spending just to spend isn't profitable. Only include real and necessary business expenses. This calculator accounts for that expense percentage."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Should my rate be the same for all projects?",
          "answer": "Not necessarily. You can have a base rate for standard projects and adjust based on: urgency (rush = more expensive), technical complexity, project duration (long contracts may get discounts), client type (large companies vs startups), exclusivity or required availability. The important thing is your weighted average rate covers your total costs."
