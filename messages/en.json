From July 2026, all freelancers must use approved software that generates invoices with QR code and sends information to AEAT in real-time. Invoo is 100% Verifactu compliant."

      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How do I share invoices with my gestoría?",
        "answer": "Your gestoría gets free access to a dashboard where they see all your invoices and expenses in real-time. You don't need to send PDFs by email or chase documents. Invite your gestoría once, and from then on everything syncs automatically."

      "q4": {
        "question": "How long does it take to create my first invoice?",

We'll notify you in-app when we switch to production AEAT endpoints. If you wait until the last minute (like 38-40% of the self-employed, per surveys), you might face rushed adaptation costs; consider testing Invoo now for a smooth transition."

            "question": "Does VeriFactu mean invoices are \"approved\" instantly by AEAT?",
            "answer": "No. Your invoice includes the QR and is submitted to AEAT, but acceptance depends on them. You can track the status and correct it if needed (e.g., rectifications)."

            "question": "What are the penalties for non-compliance with VeriFactu?",
            "answer": "Up to €50,000 for not using approved software or tampering with records. Avoid it with Invoo, which ensures traceability. If preferring alternatives, check they're AEAT-certified, but Invoo integrates directly, reducing operational risks."

          "q7": {
            "question": "Can I still use Excel or Word for invoicing?",

      "title": "Born from Real Experience",
      "description": "When we moved to Spain, we quickly discovered the maze that freelancers navigate daily — endless invoicing, scattered expenses, and complex tax obligations. Every autónomo we met shared the same story: hours lost to paperwork that should take minutes.\nMeanwhile, gestorías told us their side: outdated Excel files, manual data entry, and constant back-and-forth with clients just to get basic information.\nThen Verifactu arrived — a regulatory change that could've made things worse. Instead, we saw opportunity. The perfect moment to build something better.\nThat's how Invoo was born: a platform that speaks both languages — the simplicity freelancers need and the comprehensive data gestorías require. Less time on paperwork, more time on what matters."

Gestoría dashboards that update in real-time.\nNo more \"can you resend that invoice from March?\" No more Sunday afternoons lost to Excel. Just smooth, simple, compliant invoicing that everyone can trust."

          "answer": "In Spain there are four VAT rates: the standard 21% which applies to most products and services; the reduced 10% for food, transport and hospitality; the super-reduced 4% for essential products such as bread, milk and medicines; and 0% for exempt services such as healthcare and education."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "How do I calculate VAT for an invoice?",
          "answer": "To calculate VAT, multiply the base amount by the VAT rate divided by 100. For example, for a base of €100 with 21% VAT: 100 × 0.21 = €21 VAT. The invoice total would be €121. Our calculator does this calculation automatically."

        "q3": {
          "question": "How do I extract VAT from a price that already includes it?",
          "answer": "To extract VAT from a final price, divide the total by 1 plus the VAT rate. For example, for a price of €121 with 21% VAT: 121 ÷ 1.21 = €100 base amount. The VAT would be €21. Select 'Extract VAT from total' in our calculator to perform this calculation."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What VAT should I apply to my services as a freelancer?",
          "answer": "Most professional services are taxed at 21% standard VAT. However, some services have reduced rates or are exempt. For example, healthcare services are exempt, as is regulated training. Consult with your accountant if you have doubts about your specific activity."

        "q5": {
          "question": "When do I have to file quarterly VAT (form 303)?",
          "answer": "Freelancers and SMBs must file form 303 quarterly: by April 20 (Q1), July 20 (Q2), October 20 (Q3) and January 30 of the following year (Q4). In the form you declare the output VAT (charged) minus the input VAT (paid), and pay or offset the difference."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "What is input VAT and output VAT?",
          "answer": "Output VAT is what you charge your customers on your sales invoices. Input VAT is what you pay on invoices from your suppliers and deductible expenses. In the quarterly declaration, you subtract input from output: if the result is positive, you pay; if negative, you can offset or request a refund."

        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "How is a freelancer's net salary calculated?",
          "answer": "Net salary = Billing - Deductible expenses - Freelancer quota - Income tax. First, subtract expenses from your billing to get net income. Then pay the freelancer quota based on your bracket. Finally, income tax is calculated on what's left minus personal deductions."

          "question": "What percentage of my billing goes to taxes?",
          "answer": "It depends on your income, but typically 30% to 45% of gross billing goes to taxes and contributions. For low billing (< €20,000), the percentage may be lower (25-35%). For high income (> €60,000), it can exceed 45%."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Is it worth increasing expenses to pay less tax?",
          "answer": "Only if they're real and necessary expenses for your activity. Every euro of deductible expense saves you between €0.19 and €0.47 in income tax (depending on your bracket). It doesn't make sense to spend €100 to save €25 in taxes. But you should ensure you include all legitimate expenses."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "How much do I save with the Flat Rate?",
          "answer": "The Flat Rate lets you pay only €80/month for the first 12 months (extendable to 24 if income is low). If your normal quota would be €300/month, you save €220/month × 12 = €2,640 the first year. It's significant savings for those starting out."

          "answer": "It depends on your sector, experience, and net salary goal. A junior developer might charge €30-50/h, while a senior can exceed €80-100/h. An experienced consultant or designer can bill between €60-150/h. Use this calculator by entering your desired net salary to get your optimal rate."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Why does my hourly rate need to be so high?",
          "answer": "As a freelancer, out of every euro you bill, you only take home 50-70 cents net. The rest goes to income tax (19-47%), social security (~€230-530/month in 2026), deductible expenses (20-40%), and non-billable time (vacation, administration, sales). That's why your hourly rate must be 2-3 times your desired 'hourly salary'. And no, it's not that you're charging too much: it's that being self-employed costs a lot."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "How many billable hours does a freelancer have per year?",
          "answer": "Typically between 1,200-1,600 hours annually. If you work 40h/week × 48 weeks (minus 4 vacation) = 1,920 total hours. But of those, 20-40% goes to non-billable tasks: administration, client acquisition, training, internal meetings. That's why 1,400-1,500 actual billable hours is common."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Should I include VAT in my hourly rate?",
          "answer": "No. VAT (generally 21%) is added to the final price but isn't your income—you must give it to the tax authorities. Your hourly rate should cover: your net salary + income tax + social security + expenses. VAT is separate and neutral (you collect it from clients and pay it to authorities, though you can deduct VAT from your expenses)."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "How do deductible expenses affect my rate?",
          "answer": "Expenses reduce your tax base, so you pay less income tax and social security. If you spend 20% of billing on deductible expenses, your tax burden will be lower than if you spend 0%. But be careful: spending just to spend isn't profitable. Only include real and necessary business expenses. This calculator accounts for that expense percentage."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Should my rate be the same for all projects?",
          "answer": "Not necessarily. You can have a base rate for standard projects and adjust based on: urgency (rush = more expensive), technical complexity, project duration (long contracts may get discounts), client type (large companies vs startups), exclusivity or required availability. The important thing is your weighted average rate covers your total costs."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "What if my clients say I'm too expensive?",
          "answer": "First, verify they're your target audience. If you bill B2B (companies), your €50-80/h rate is normal and profitable for them (you're saving them hiring a €40,000-50,000/year employee). Second, justify the value: don't sell 'hours', sell results. Instead of '€40/h', say 'this project will save you €X per year'. Third, if they still say it's expensive, they're not your client: find another one."
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "Does this calculator use correct 2026 Spanish tax data?",
          "answer": "Yes. We use current national income tax brackets (19-47% progressive), real income social security brackets per Royal Decree-law 13/2022, and the €5,550 personal allowance.

        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What expenses can I deduct in Form 303?",
          "answer": "All expenses linked to your economic activity with an invoice in your name: office rent, utilities, materials, software, phone, accounting, insurance, advertising, business travel. You cannot deduct personal expenses or those without invoices."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What happens if the result is negative?",
          "answer": "If your input VAT exceeds output VAT, you have two options: offset that balance in following quarters (box 87 → box 110 of the next quarter) or request a refund in Q4 if you've had accumulated negative balance all year."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "Can I request a VAT refund in any quarter?",
          "answer": "No. You can only request a refund in the Q4 return (January). In quarters Q1, Q2, and Q3, negative balances can only be offset in subsequent periods. There's an exception: companies registered in REDEME can request monthly refunds."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "What's the difference between Form 303 and Form 390?",
          "answer": "Form 303 is the quarterly VAT self-assessment. Form 390 is the annual informative summary presenting year totals. It doesn't involve additional payment, only information. Since 2024, many freelancers are exempt from Form 390 if they meet certain requirements."

          "question": "Can I file Form 130 if the result is zero or negative?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can and sometimes must. If it's zero, file with zero result. If negative, it doesn't generate a right to refund in this form (that balance is settled in the annual return), but you file with box 7 at zero."

        "q5": {
          "question": "What's the relationship between Form 130 and the annual income tax return?",
          "answer": "Form 130 is an advance on your annual IRPF. What you pay quarterly is subtracted from your final tax in the annual return. If you paid more than owed, the tax authority refunds you; if less, you pay the difference."
        },
        "q6": {

        "q5": {
          "question": "Do I need an invoice to deduct an expense?",
          "answer": "Yes, to deduct VAT you need a complete invoice with all tax details. For IRPF, in some cases a receipt or bank statement suffices, but it's recommended to always request an invoice. The self-employed contribution is justified with the bank statement."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Can I deduct business meals?",
          "answer": "IMPORTANT: VAT on meals and hospitality is NOT deductible (Art. 96.1.6º LIVA). You can only deduct the base amount for IRPF purposes. The expense must be justified with an invoice, must be outside your municipality of residence, and total deductions cannot exceed 1% of your annual revenue. Always keep the invoice and note the meeting reason."

          "question": "From what income level is it worth creating an SL?",
          "answer": "There's no exact figure, it depends on your desired salary and expenses. As a general rule, with net profits (after expenses) above €40,000-50,000 annually, SL is usually more advantageous due to the differential between IRPF (up to 47%) and Corporate Tax (25%). Use the calculator with your real data to know for sure."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What is the 15% reduced Corporate Tax rate?",
          "answer": "If it's your first SL and you haven't been an administrator of another company in the last 5 years, you can apply 15% Corporate Tax (instead of 25%) during the first 2 fiscal years with profits, on the first €300,000. It's a tax advantage to encourage entrepreneurship."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "How much does it cost to create and maintain an SL?",
          "answer": "Creating an SL costs between €500-1,000 (notary, commercial registry). Annual maintenance includes accountant (€1,800-3,000/year), account filing, corporate tax. Fixed costs are significantly higher than as freelancer (accountant ~€600/year)."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Can I deduct more expenses in an SL than as freelancer?",
          "answer": "Not necessarily. Deductible expenses must be related to the activity in both cases. The difference is in how they're taxed: in SL you first pay Corporate Tax on company profit, then IRPF if you distribute dividends. Allows more flexibility in tax planning."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "What happens with Social Security in an SL?",
          "answer": "As SL administrator you contribute to General SS Regime, not as self-employed. Contributions are higher (company pays ~36%, you ~5% of gross salary), but in return you have better coverage (unemployment, work accidents). Total quota can exceed self-employed."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Can I switch from freelancer to SL without deregistering?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can create an SL and continue as freelancer temporarily to make the transition. Many entrepreneurs create the SL, gradually transfer the activity, then deregister as self-employed. You can also maintain both if you do different activities."
