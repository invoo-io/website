          "q1": {
            "question": "Is Invoo VeriFactu compliant?",
            "answer": "Yes. Invoo is built to meet the VeriFactu Regulation (RD 1007/2023). We generate the VeriFactu QR and manage the AEAT submission flow through our API provider. You can review statuses and export evidence for audits."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "When does VeriFactu become mandatory?",
            "answer": "For software developers, from July 2025; for companies, from January 2026; and for the self-employed, from July 2026. Some details roll out in stages. We'll notify you in-app when we switch to production AEAT endpoints. If you wait until the last minute (like 38-40% of the self-employed, per surveys), you might face rushed adaptation costs; consider testing Invoo now for a smooth transition."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "Does VeriFactu mean invoices are \"approved\" instantly by AEAT?",
            "answer": "No. Your invoice includes the QR and is submitted to AEAT, but acceptance depends on them. You can track the status and correct it if needed (e.g., rectifications)."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "Do I need my own digital certificate?",
            "answer": "Not to start. Our provider handles the secure exchange with AEAT; we manage technical payloads and return the QR and status. For enterprise customizations (like using your certificate), contact us later."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "Who is required to use VeriFactu?",
            "answer": "Self-employed, SMEs, and companies billing under €6M annually, except for exemptions like REGE or large SII contributors. If you're a freelancer with few clients, choose simple software like Invoo; for gestorías with hundreds of clients, contact us for a better plan."
          },
          "q6": {
            "question": "What are the penalties for non-compliance with VeriFactu?",
            "answer": "Up to €50,000 for not using approved software or tampering with records. Avoid it with Invoo, which ensures traceability. If preferring alternatives, check they're AEAT-certified, but Invoo integrates directly, reducing operational risks."
          },
          "q7": {
            "question": "Can I still use Excel or Word for invoicing?",
            "answer": "No, VeriFactu requires approved software that sends data in real-time to AEAT. Invoo replaces that with a dead-simple interface; as an option, migrate Excel data via CSV, but we recommend automating to save billable time."

            "answer": "Freelancers (autónomos) in Spain and their gestorías. We optimize for Spain-specific compliance and workflows. We don't replace your gestor, but enhance it, improving retention by reducing coordination errors."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "What does Invoo include at launch?",
            "answer": "Core invoicing with VeriFactu QR + AEAT submission, expense capture, quarterly pre-calcs (Modelos 130 y 303), gestoría access, and CSV exports. Advanced features like multi-currency roll out progressively. Test the free plan to validate; if needing scalability, upgrade to Pro."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "Is there a mobile app?",
            "answer": "Desktop-first, but mobile web is fully usable for on-the-go receipt scanning. A native app may come if demanded; meanwhile, use the browser for operational simplicity."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "Does Invoo support recurring invoices?",
            "answer": "Yes, automate monthly sends for fixed clients. Set variations for extras without complexity. This maximizes billable hours; alternate with manual reminders if preferring total control, but automation lowers errors."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "Is Invoo easy for non-tech-savvy users?",
            "answer": "Absolutely, with a dead-simple interface and step-by-step guides. Create invoices in <30 seconds without manual calculations. If the learning curve concerns you, start with our free onboarding; or integrate with your gestoría to delegate."
          },
          "q6": {
            "question": "Does Invoo handle multi-currency and international VAT?",
            "answer": "Yes, it supports automatic conversions and VAT handling for foreign clients. It reduces tax complexity; as an alternative, export to external tools, but native integration simplifies retention."

      "title": "Born from Real Experience",
      "description": "When we moved to Spain, we quickly discovered the maze that freelancers navigate daily — endless invoicing, scattered expenses, and complex tax obligations. Every autónomo we met shared the same story: hours lost to paperwork that should take minutes.\nMeanwhile, gestorías told us their side: outdated Excel files, manual data entry, and constant back-and-forth with clients just to get basic information.\nThen Verifactu arrived — a regulatory change that could've made things worse. Instead, we saw opportunity. The perfect moment to build something better.\nThat's how Invoo was born: a platform that speaks both languages — the simplicity freelancers need and the comprehensive data gestorías require. Less time on paperwork, more time on what matters."

Gestoría dashboards that update in real-time.\nNo more \"can you resend that invoice from March?\" No more Sunday afternoons lost to Excel. Just smooth, simple, compliant invoicing that everyone can trust."
