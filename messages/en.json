From July 2026, all freelancers must use approved software that generates invoices with QR code and sends information to AEAT in real-time. Invoo is 100% Verifactu compliant."

      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How do I share invoices with my gestoría?",
        "answer": "Your gestoría gets free access to a dashboard where they see all your invoices and expenses in real-time. You don't need to send PDFs by email or chase documents. Invite your gestoría once, and from then on everything syncs automatically."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How long does it take to create my first invoice?",
        "answer": "Less than 2 minutes including initial registration. Once your tax profile and first client are configured, subsequent invoices take 30 seconds."

        "question": "Does Invoo calculate VAT and withholdings automatically?",

            "answer": "For software developers, from July 2025; for companies, from January 2026; and for the self-employed, from July 2026. Some details roll out in stages. We'll notify you in-app when we switch to production AEAT endpoints. If you wait until the last minute (like 38-40% of the self-employed, per surveys), you might face rushed adaptation costs; consider testing Invoo now for a smooth transition."

          "q3": {
            "question": "Does VeriFactu mean invoices are \"approved\" instantly by AEAT?",
            "answer": "No. Your invoice includes the QR and is submitted to AEAT, but acceptance depends on them. You can track the status and correct it if needed (e.g., rectifications)."

          "q6": {
            "question": "What are the penalties for non-compliance with VeriFactu?",
            "answer": "Up to €50,000 for not using approved software or tampering with records. Avoid it with Invoo, which ensures traceability. If preferring alternatives, check they're AEAT-certified, but Invoo integrates directly, reducing operational risks."

          "q7": {
            "question": "Can I still use Excel or Word for invoicing?",

      "title": "Born from Real Experience",
      "description": "When we moved to Spain, we quickly discovered the maze that freelancers navigate daily — endless invoicing, scattered expenses, and complex tax obligations. Every autónomo we met shared the same story: hours lost to paperwork that should take minutes.\nMeanwhile, gestorías told us their side: outdated Excel files, manual data entry, and constant back-and-forth with clients just to get basic information.\nThen Verifactu arrived — a regulatory change that could've made things worse. Instead, we saw opportunity. The perfect moment to build something better.\nThat's how Invoo was born: a platform that speaks both languages — the simplicity freelancers need and the comprehensive data gestorías require. Less time on paperwork, more time on what matters."

Professional invoices that create themselves. Verifactu compliance that happens automatically. Gestoría dashboards that update in real-time.\nNo more \"can you resend that invoice from March?\" No more Sunday afternoons lost to Excel. Just smooth, simple, compliant invoicing that everyone can trust."

The use of Invoo, including automated submission of Invoicing Records, does not exempt the User from the duty to review their invoices or verify the correct filing of their tax obligations.\n\nThe User must maintain adequate copies of their tax documentation and, when acting through a gestoría, verify that it has the necessary information to carry out its work.

Likewise, the User may not modify, reverse engineer, or reproduce the technical operation of the Platform for purposes other than those permitted in these Terms.\n\nThe User is obligated to keep their data and access credentials protected and to inform Invoo without delay of any unauthorized access or suspicion of a security breach. They will be responsible for damages generated by negligent use, lack of custody of their keys, or access made under their credentials.\n\nFinally, the User declares that they have the necessary authorizations to enter personal data of third parties on the Platform, complying with corresponding information obligations and keeping Invoo harmless from any claim that third parties may make in relation to such data."
