        "question": "I already have an accountant. How does the connection with Invoo work?",
        "answer": "Your accountant gets free access to a dashboard where they see all your invoices and expenses in real-time. No emails with PDFs, no chasing documents, no misunderstandings. Invite your accountant once and from then on everything syncs automatically. It's what sets us apart: collaboration with your advisor included in the price, not an €80/month extra."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "I use Holded/Quipu and have too many features. Is Invoo different?",
        "answer": "Invoo is just invoicing. No CRM, no inventory, no HR modules you'll never use. You pay €10.90/month for complete professional invoicing: quotes, invoices, expenses, discounts, multi-currency, and your accountant connected. You use 100% of what you pay for."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How much time does invoicing take each month?",
        "answer": "30 seconds per invoice, verified. Quote to invoice in 1 click. Expenses via photo from your mobile. If you invoice 10-15 clients per month, that's 15 minutes. Not 6 hours like with Excel. Time you reclaim for billable work, not admin."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Do I need to do something special to comply with Verifactu?",
        "answer": "No. Invoo generates Verifactu-compliant invoices from day 1. QR code, AEAT submission, all automatic. Your accountant sees it, you forget about it. When July 2027 arrives, you'll already be compliant without having done anything extra."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "I invoice clients outside Spain. Does Invoo handle VAT?",
        "answer": "Yes. Invoice in euros, dollars, or pounds. VAT is calculated automatically based on the client's country: intra-community, export, or domestic. No conversion errors, no confusion with ROI or form 349. Your accountant sees international invoices just like domestic ones."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "I'm coming from Excel. How much does it cost to migrate?",
        "answer": "5 minutes of initial setup: tax details, logo, first client. From there, each invoice takes 30 seconds. No learning curve. If you use WhatsApp, you already know how to use Invoo. You save time from day one."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "€10.90/month seems expensive for a freelancer. Is it worth it?",
        "answer": "€10.90 is less than an hour of your work. You recover that time on your first invoice of the month. Not counting the stress you save with automatic Verifactu and your accountant always up to date. Competitors like Holded charge €29+/month for features you'll never use."

      "q2": {
        "question": "How many clients can I manage from the dashboard?",

        "question": "Does Invoo replace my accounting software?",
        "answer": "No. Invoo is just invoicing and income/expenses. It doesn't do accounting or complex tax forms. Your flow would be: your clients invoice in Invoo → you export CSV from firm dashboard → import to your usual accounting software. Invoo replaces the chaos of WhatsApp PDFs, not your accounting system."

        "question": "What happens if a client stops using Invoo or goes to another firm?",

They can also export. No lock-in: data always exportable. If they go to another firm, the new firm accesses equally (free) if the client keeps using Invoo."

      "q7": {

        "answer": "Invoo makes it automatic for everyone. Your clients invoice, Invoo generates compliant Verifactu record (hash, chain, signature). From the dashboard you see each client's compliance status. No installing software in each business, no explaining regulations, no panic calls. Multi-client Verifactu on autopilot."

          "q1": {
            "question": "What is Invoo and who is it for?",
            "answer": "Invoo is invoicing software for freelancers and SMEs in Spain that includes connection with your accountant. Unlike ERPs like Holded that include CRM, inventory, and modules you'll never use, we only do invoicing. Invoice in 30 seconds, your accountant sees everything instantly, automatic Verifactu. Designed for those who want to invoice professionally without complications. If you have between 1 and 100 invoices per month and work with an accountant (or want to work with one), Invoo is for you."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "How long does it take to start with Invoo?",
            "answer": "5 minutes for freelancers, 10 minutes for SMEs with a team. Create your account, add your tax details (CIF, address), enter a couple of clients, and you're ready to invoice. No implementation, no weeks of training, no 2-hour videos. The first day you use Invoo, you're already invoicing faster than with Word or Excel. Compared to Holded or Quipu, which require days of setup, Invoo is ready before you finish your coffee."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "I'm coming from Excel/Word. Is it hard to migrate?",
            "answer": "No, it's easier than what you use now. If you can use WhatsApp, you can use Invoo. Enter client name, concept, amount. Invoo calculates VAT and withholding tax automatically (goodbye calculator). Generate the PDF and send it in 30 seconds. No broken formulas, no outdated templates. You can import your client list from a CSV if you want to save typing. Also, from July 2027, Word and Excel will be illegal for B2B invoicing. Better to migrate now without rush than in June 2027 with the tax authority on your back."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "I already use Holded/Quipu. Why switch to Invoo?",
            "answer": "Because you're paying for features you don't need. Holded costs €29+/month and includes CRM, inventory, and HR modules. If you're a freelancer, you use 5% of what you pay for. Invoo costs €10.90/month and gives you 100% of what you need to invoice: quotes that convert to invoices in 1 click, line-item discounts, automatic Verifactu, multi-currency, and your accountant connected for free. In Holded, you'd pay €80/month extra to connect your accountant. Plus, Invoo support responds in hours, not weeks. Migration takes 15 minutes. Try and compare."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "Do I have to leave my accountant to use Invoo?",
            "answer": "No, quite the opposite. Your accountant stays with you and you actually make their life easier. With Invoo, your accountant accesses a free dashboard where they see all your invoices in real time. No emails, no attached PDFs, no WhatsApps at 11pm asking where November's invoice is. You invoice, they see it instantly. Many accountants recommend us to their clients because it saves them hours of manual work. If your accountant says they don't want you to use software, send them our website. When they see the free dashboard, they change their mind."
          },
          "q6": {
            "question": "Do I need technical knowledge to use Invoo?",
            "answer": "No. If you use WhatsApp or Gmail, you can use Invoo. We designed the interface for Carmen, a 48-year-old freelancer who's been invoicing with Word for 8 years. No complicated menus, no modules to configure, no weird integrations. Open Invoo, enter client and concept, save. Done. Invoo calculates taxes, generates the PDF, and sends it. Our record is a freelancer who created her first invoice in 90 seconds without help. If you get stuck, human support responds in hours."
          },
          "q7": {
            "question": "Can I import my clients and old invoices?",
            "answer": "Yes. Import clients from a CSV (Excel) with name, tax ID, and email. Takes 2 minutes. Old invoices can be uploaded as attachments to have everything centralized, but we don't migrate them automatically because each software has a different format. However, for tax purposes, you only need invoices from when you start with Invoo onwards. The tax authority doesn't ask you to redo your history. What matters is that from July 2027, all new B2B invoices must comply with Verifactu. Starting with Invoo now gives you time to get used to it without pressure."
          },
          "q8": {
            "question": "What makes Invoo different from other invoicing software?",
            "answer": "Three things. First, your accountant is already connected by default, free. Competitors charge €80/month extra for that or simply don't offer it. Second, we only do invoicing. No CRM, no inventory, no modules you'll never use. You use 100% of what you pay for. Third, real speed. Invoice in 30 seconds, quote to invoice in 1 click, setup in 5 minutes. Compared to Holded (€29+/month, weeks of implementation), Quipu (questionable security, no 2FA), or Billin (no multi-currency), Invoo is exactly what you need. No more, no less. €10.90/month, everything included."

          "q1": {
            "question": "How does the connection with my accountant work?",
            "answer": "Simple: you invoice, your accountant sees it instantly. Invite your accountant from your account (enter their email), they receive access to a free dashboard where they see all your invoices, expenses, and income in real time. No sending PDFs, no exporting Excel, no back-and-forth emails. Your accountant can filter by date, download what they need for tax returns, and see everything consolidated. They don't have to ask you for anything. You maintain control: you decide what they see and when. You can revoke access anytime. It's like collaborative Google Drive, but designed for invoicing."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "Does my accountant have to pay anything?",
            "answer": "No, nothing. The accountant dashboard is free for your accountant, included in your €10.90/month (freelancers) or €19.90/month (SMEs) plan. Competitors like Holded charge €80/month extra for the accounting connection. We include it because we understand that freelancer + accountant = team. Your accountant only needs an email to access. If they manage 50 clients with Invoo, they access all 50 from a single panel. No licenses, no hidden costs. Win-win: you pay less, your accountant saves time, we gain happy customers."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "What exactly does my accountant see in their dashboard?",
            "answer": "Your accountant sees: all your issued invoices (with status: paid, pending, overdue), all your registered expenses, income and expense totals by quarter, data ready for quarterly tax returns. They can download individual PDFs or export CSV with everything consolidated. They can't see your password, can't modify invoices, can't delete anything. Read-only and download only. You control permissions from your panel. If you only want them to see invoices from the last quarter, you configure the filter. It's your data, your control. They see what you decide."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "Can I use Invoo if my accountant doesn't want to use it?",
            "answer": "Yes, but you'll be losing half the value. Invoo works without a connected accountant: you can invoice, export PDFs, and email them as always. But you lose the magic: zero emails, zero waiting, zero 'I'm missing invoice 0234'. Our experience: 90% of accountants who say 'no' change their mind when they see the free dashboard. Send your accountant our website or ask them to contact us. If they really don't want to, you can still use Invoo and export manually. But we recommend insisting. Many freelancers have switched accountants because of this: if your accountant refuses to use tools that make your life easier, maybe they're not the right accountant."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "If I have multiple users (SME), does my accountant see invoices from everyone?",
            "answer": "Yes, that's exactly what the SME plan is for. Your accountant sees all invoices from all users in your company in one place. They can filter by user, by date, by client, by status. They see who invoiced what and when. This is critical for tax returns: your accountant needs to consolidate your entire team before filing quarterly returns. With Invoo, they click 'export Q1' and download everything. No chasing 4 people, no merging Excel files. That's why the SME plan (€19.90/month for 4 users) includes total visibility: you as admin see your whole team, your accountant sees your whole team. Absolute control, zero chaos."
          },
          "q6": {
            "question": "What happens if I change accountants?",
            "answer": "Revoke access from the old accountant and invite the new one. Takes 30 seconds. Your invoices remain yours, they don't depend on who views them. The new accountant accesses the complete history since you started using Invoo. No migration, no data loss. This is another advantage of Invoo: your data isn't on your accountant's computer like with proprietary accounting software or Excel they control. It's in your Invoo account. You decide who has access. Changing accountants is already stressful enough. With Invoo, at least the technical part is trivial."

        "questions": {
          "q1": {
            "question": "What is Verifactu and why does it affect me?",
            "answer": "Verifactu is the new AEAT regulation to combat tax fraud through invoicing software. From July 2027, all freelancers and SMEs who invoice B2B (to other businesses) must use approved software that generates a QR code per invoice and sends information to the tax authority in real time. Goal: prevent fake invoices and record manipulation. If you invoice with Word, Excel, or non-approved software, your B2B invoices will be illegal. It affects you if: you're a freelancer or SME, you invoice less than €6M/year, and your clients are businesses (B2B). Solution: use software like Invoo that already complies with Verifactu. If you wait until June 2027, you'll be rushed and stressed. If you start now, you'll arrive calm."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "Is Invoo ready for Verifactu?",
            "answer": "Yes, from day 1. Invoo automatically generates the Verifactu QR code on each invoice and handles submission to the AEAT through our API. You invoice normally, we handle the technical part. When Verifactu becomes mandatory in July 2027, you don't have to do anything: your Invoo already complies. No updates, no migrations, no surprises. Plus, we export audit evidence and show the status of each invoice (submitted, accepted, rejected). 82% of SMEs aren't prepared for Verifactu. You will be."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "Can I continue using Excel or Word to invoice?",
            "answer": "Until July 2027, yes. But after that, not for B2B invoices (businesses). Verifactu prohibits non-approved software for invoicing between businesses. You can continue using Word for B2C invoices (individuals without business activity), but you'll waste time: 10 minutes per manual invoice vs 30 seconds with Invoo. Plus, Word doesn't calculate VAT automatically, doesn't generate QR, doesn't connect with your accountant. Many people say 'my Word has worked for 8 years'. But from July 2027, it won't comply with Verifactu for B2B. Better to migrate now without pressure than wait until the last minute."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "What are the penalties for not complying with Verifactu?",
            "answer": "Fines of up to €50,000 for not using approved software or manipulating tax records. The tax authority can audit your invoices and if they detect you're using Word/Excel after July 2027 for B2B, they'll sanction you. Serious violations include: invoices without Verifactu QR, non-approved software, manipulation of accounting records. It's not an empty threat: Verifactu exists because there is fraud. The tax authority is serious. The good news is that avoiding it is easy: use software like Invoo that complies automatically. €10.90/month is much less than a €50,000 fine. Do the math."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "Do I have to do anything special to comply with Verifactu?",
            "answer": "No, if you use Invoo. Verifactu is automatic: create your invoice normally, Invoo generates the QR, sends the info to AEAT, and shows you the status. You don't touch anything. You don't need a digital certificate (we manage it), you don't need to understand the technical regulation, you don't need to configure anything. Just invoice. Compared to other options where you have to download plugins, configure APIs, or manually manage certificates, Invoo is invisible. The best technology is the one you don't notice. Invoice as always, we handle the rest. That's how it should be."
          },
          "q6": {
            "question": "If I invoice with Invoo, does my accountant have less work on tax returns?",
            "answer": "Yes, much less. Your accountant accesses all your Verifactu invoices from their dashboard, downloads CSV with totals of income, expenses, VAT, and withholding tax already calculated. No asking for invoices via WhatsApp, no consolidating PDFs, no manually typing data. For quarterly tax returns, they export everything in one click. This reduces errors (data comes directly from your approved software) and saves time (fewer hours of data entry = lower cost for you). Many accountants reduce fees if the client uses well-integrated software. Ask your accountant: they'll probably say yes, Invoo makes their life easier."
          },
          "q7": {
            "question": "Does Invoo support TicketBAI (Basque Country)?",
            "answer": "Yes. TicketBAI is mandatory in the Basque Country since 2024 for all invoices. Invoo generates the TicketBAI XML file, digitally signs each invoice, and sends to the Regional Tax Authorities (Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa, Araba). Works the same as Verifactu: you invoice, we handle the technical part. If you have activity in the Basque Country and the rest of Spain, Invoo handles both: TicketBAI for Euskadi, Verifactu for the rest. One software, two regulations covered. No complications, no duplicating tools."

Everything included: unlimited invoices, quotes, expenses, Verifactu, TicketBAI, multi-currency, discounts, free accountant dashboard, human support. No hidden costs, no charges for 'extra modules', no invoice limits. You pay what you see. Compared to Holded (€29+/month without connected accountant), Quipu (€17+/month without many features), or online accountants (€30+/month without personal relationship), Invoo is cheaper and more complete. Fixed price, no surprises. Cancel whenever you want."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "€10.90/month seems expensive for a freelancer. Is it worth it?",
            "answer": "Depends on how much you value your time. If you invoice 10 times a month with Word (10 minutes each), you lose 100 minutes = 1h40min. With Invoo (30 seconds per invoice), it's 5 minutes. You save 1h35min per month. If your hour is worth €30, you recover €47.50 monthly. €10.90 is less than an hour of your work. Plus, you avoid VAT errors that can cost you penalties, your accountant sees everything instantly (fewer emails = less friction), and you comply with Verifactu automatically (avoid fines up to €50,000). Clear ROI: pay €10.90, save time, avoid penalties, gain peace of mind. Expensive? No. Necessary."

Create your account, invoice, test everything (including accountant dashboard), and decide if you stay. No commitment. If you're not convinced, cancel and pay nothing. Our bet is that after creating your first invoice in 30 seconds and seeing how your accountant accesses without emails, you won't want to go back to Word. If you want priority access, join the waiting list. We'll let you know when we open."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "Can I cancel whenever I want?",
            "answer": "Yes, without penalties or awkward questions. Cancel from your panel in 10 seconds. Your subscription ends at the end of the paid period (if you cancel on January 15 and paid until February 1, you have access until February 1). You can export all your invoices in PDF or CSV before leaving. Your data is yours. No ties, no forced annual contracts, no 'retention' calls. We believe that if Invoo is good, you stay because you want to. If not, you leave. Simple. Honest. As it should be."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "What does the SME plan (€19.90/month) include?",
            "answer": "Everything from the freelancer plan, plus team management. Up to 4 users can invoice from the same account, you as admin see who invoiced what and when, shared automatic numbering (impossible to duplicate invoices), your accountant sees all invoices from all users in their dashboard, filters by user for internal audit. Perfect for agencies, studios, consultancies, small retailers. Compared to Holded (€100+/month for 4 users) or Factorial (€4.5/user/month = €18/month, without full invoicing), Invoo is cheaper and focused. €19.90/month = €5 per user. Less than what you lose on an invoice error."

Invoo calculates VAT and withholding tax automatically, generates PDF with Verifactu QR, and sends by email if you want. First invoice of the day: 30 seconds. Tenth invoice: 25 seconds (you've got the rhythm). Compared to Word (10 minutes: open template, update data, calculate taxes, save PDF, send), or Excel (5-8 minutes), or Holded (2 minutes navigating complex menus), Invoo is brutal. Real speed, measured, verifiable. Time it yourself."

            "answer": "Yes. Create invoices in EUR, USD, GBP, or other currencies, Invoo applies VAT rules automatically based on destination country (intra-EU, extra-EU, reverse charge). For UK clients post-Brexit: invoice without VAT with 'Reverse charge' mention. For EU clients with valid intra-EU tax ID: no VAT, but register in form 349. For clients outside EU: no VAT, export. All automatic. You enter the client's country, Invoo decides which rule to apply. No errors, no consulting your accountant each time. David, a tech freelancer with clients in London and Berlin, invoices in 30 seconds without thinking about VAT. That's how it works."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "Can I automate recurring invoices?",
            "answer": "Yes. Set up a recurring invoice (client, concept, amount, frequency: monthly, quarterly, annual), Invoo generates and sends it automatically each period. Perfect for Miguel, who invoices €5,000/month to the same client for 2 years. Set it once, forget about it. Every 1st of the month, Invoo creates the invoice, sends PDF to the client, notifies the accountant. Miguel doesn't touch anything. Saves 15 minutes per month. If one month the amount changes, edit punctually. If you want to pause, pause. Automation that's not scary: you control, Invoo executes."

            "answer": "Yes, in 1 click. Create a quote with client, line items, discounts. Send to client. Client accepts (by email or digital signature if configured). Enter Invoo, open accepted quote, 'Convert to invoice' button. Done. No rewriting, no copy-pasting, no errors. Automatic numbering, updated date, status changes to 'Invoice issued'. This saves 5-10 minutes per accepted quote. If you make 5 quotes per month and 3 become invoices, you save 15-30 minutes. Plus, your accountant sees quotes and invoices linked: total traceability."

          "q5": {
            "question": "Can I apply discounts on invoices?",
            "answer": "Yes, by line or global. Line discount: enter product/service €100, apply 10% discount, Invoo shows €90 and calculates VAT on €90. Global discount: enter 3 services (total €500), apply 15% global discount, Invoo calculates on €425. Useful for promotions, VIP clients, negotiations. Compared to Word (calculate discount manually = errors) or software that charges for 'discount module', Invoo includes it free. Discounts are part of professional invoicing, not an extra. They're there, use them when you want."
          },
          "q6": {
            "question": "If I have a team (SME), how do I know who created each invoice?",

Useful for internal audit (who invoiced client X?), for commercial tracking (how much did each salesperson invoice this month?), for control (did someone invoice without authorization?). Your accountant also sees this info in their dashboard. Compared to shared Excel where nobody knows who edited what, or Holded where this info is buried in menus, Invoo puts it front and center. Laura, agency owner with 4 employees, uses it for quarterly bonuses: exports invoices by user, calculates commissions. Total transparency."

You enter €1,000, Invoo does the rest. No calculator, no Excel formulas, no errors. If invoicing professional services: 15% withholding (7% if you're a new freelancer). If selling products: 21% VAT, no withholding. If exporting outside EU: no VAT, no withholding. All according to current AEAT regulations. Impossible to make mistakes. Carmen, 48, invoicing with Word since 2015, had to pay €300 to the tax authority for a VAT error. With Invoo: zero errors."

            "question": "Can I record expenses in Invoo?",
            "answer": "Yes. Record expenses (concept, amount, VAT, category: supplies, software, transport), upload receipt photo or received invoice PDF. Your accountant sees your expenses in their dashboard, exports them for quarterly deductions. Useful for: keeping monthly track of spending, having centralized receipts (goodbye phone photo folder), facilitating your accountant's work (they see expense + receipt in same place). It's not full accounting (that's what your accountant with their software is for), but it's sufficient recording for freelancers. David records 8-12 expenses per month (Notion, Figma, client coffees), his accountant downloads them in seconds. No WhatsApps, no lost photos."

          "q1": {
            "question": "How can my accountant manage multiple clients with Invoo?",
            "answer": "Your accountant accesses a single panel where they see all their clients who use Invoo. They can filter by client, download consolidated invoices, export CSV by quarter, manage Verifactu for everyone in one place. If your accountant has 50 clients on Invoo, they see all 50 from one dashboard. No logging into 50 different accounts, no chasing documents via WhatsApp. Each client invites the accountant from their account, the accountant accepts once, and has perpetual access (until the client revokes). This allows small accounting firms (2-5 employees) to compete with online services offering technology + personal relationship. Ana, accounting firm owner in Valencia with 200 clients, manages 3x more clients without hiring thanks to Invoo."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "Will my clients have to pay to use Invoo?",
            "answer": "Yes, but very little: €10.90/month freelancers, €19.90/month SMEs. Much less than they'd pay an online accountant service (€30+/month) and with the advantage of keeping you as their trusted advisor. You offer Invoo as part of your service: 'Use this tool, I see everything automatically, you make my work easier and I save you hours consolidating invoices'. Many accountants negotiate: 'If you use Invoo, I'll reduce my fees €15/month because you save me work'. Client pays €10.90 Invoo, saves €15 on accounting, gains €4 + time + peace of mind. Win-win. Invoo isn't competition, it's an ally."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "Does Invoo offer white-label for accountants?",
            "answer": "Yes, in Enterprise plan (direct contact). White-label means: your client sees your brand (your logo, your name), not Invoo. You offer 'Invoicing Portal [Your Firm]' powered by Invoo. Client uses software, thinks it's yours, you control the relationship. Price depends on number of clients. Example: accounting firm with 300 clients, €299/month flat. Client pays nothing, you include cost in your fees or charge €5 extra/client/month. Perfect for medium-sized accounting firms that want to compete with online services without losing their brand. If you have 150+ clients and are interested, contact us. We set up in 2 weeks."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "Will my clients (traditional freelancers) know how to use Invoo?",
            "answer": "Yes. We designed Invoo for Carmen: 48 years old, 8 years using Word, technology isn't her thing. If Carmen can, your clients can. Interface without complicated menus, only the essentials. Many accountants do onboarding: first invoice together on video call (10 minutes), client learns, done. After that they invoice on their own. If they get stuck, Invoo support responds (or you help if you prefer to maintain control). 95% of traditional freelancer clients who try Invoo adopt it. The remaining 5% go back to Word... until Verifactu forces them in July 2027. Better to onboard now without pressure."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "Does Invoo replace my accounting software?",
            "answer": "No, it complements it. Professional accounting software is for complete accounting, filing tax returns, multi-company management. Invoo is for client invoicing. Your workflow: client invoices in Invoo → you see invoices in Invoo dashboard → export CSV → import to your accounting software for formal accounting. Invoo doesn't replace your internal ERP, it facilitates client data capture. Without Invoo, you receive invoices via WhatsApp/email, type them manually into your system. With Invoo, you download clean CSV, import automatically. Save 2-3 hours per client per quarter. That scales: 100 clients = 200-300h saved/quarter. You can manage more clients or lower price and win volume."
          },
          "q6": {
            "question": "How does Invoo compete with online accountant services?",
            "answer": "Invoo doesn't compete with you, it helps you compete against online services. Online accountants charge €30/month and offer technology, but without personal relationship, without trusted advice. You offer: 10 years of personal relationship, you know their business, proactive advice, PLUS Invoo technology (€10.90/month client or €0 if white-label included in your fees). Client pays €80-100/month to you (traditional accounting + Invoo) vs €30/month online service. Difference of €50-70, but online is impersonal, they don't call to warn about deductions, they don't know you. You do. Invoo is your secret weapon: you modernize without losing what makes you valuable. Ana, accounting firm in Valencia, recovered 15 clients who had left for online services by offering them Invoo + her expertise. It works."

We don't sell data to third parties, we don't do marketing with your info, we don't share with anyone except your accountant (if you authorize it). Automatic daily backups, disaster recovery guaranteed. Security certificates audited annually. Compared to Excel on Dropbox (no encryption), or pirated software (where is your data?), Invoo is bank-level security. Your data is yours, always."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "Who can see my invoices and expenses?",
            "answer": "Only you, your team (if SME), and your accountant (if you invited them). No one else. Not even Invoo as a company can see your invoice content (they're encrypted). Support employees only access if you open a ticket and authorize (to resolve a technical problem). No third-party access, no weird integrations that leak data. If you revoke access from your accountant, they lose access instantly. Absolute control. This is critical: your competition can't see your clients, the tax authority sees nothing except what Verifactu sends (which is mandatory by law), no one spies. Real privacy."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "Can I export my data?",
            "answer": "Yes, everything. Export invoices in PDF (individual or batch), CSV with complete listing (client, date, amount, VAT, withholding, status), expenses in CSV, clients in CSV. Useful for: switching software (I hope not, but it's your right), doing analysis in Excel, delivering to external auditor, personal backup. Export without limits, no extra cost. Your data is yours, not Invoo hostages. GDPR requires portability, we comply gladly. 'Export all' button downloads ZIP with PDFs + CSVs. 2 minutes, done."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "What happens to my invoices if I cancel my account?",
            "answer": "You have 30 days to export everything before permanent deletion. Cancel on January 1, you can download invoices until January 31. After that, we delete your data permanently (GDPR: right to be forgotten). That's why we recommend exporting immediately when canceling. Invoo sends reminder email 7 days before deletion. We don't keep your invoices in 'dead archive' forever: you cancel, export, we delete. Clean, respectful, legal. If you cancel by mistake and 30 days pass, we can't recover (backups are overwritten). Export first, cancel second."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "Does Invoo have two-factor authentication (2FA)?",
            "answer": "Yes. Activate 2FA from settings, use authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy). Each login requires temporary code plus password. Protects against password hacks, phishing, unauthorized access. Critical if you manage company invoicing with multiple users or sensitive data. Quipu doesn't have 2FA (serious breach). Contasimple had hacked accounts. Invoo: 2FA from day 1, free, strongly recommended. Activate it, sleep well. If you lose access to authenticator app, support helps you with recovery codes (saved when activating 2FA). Security without compromise."

Transmission may occur in real-time or within the timeframes permitted by regulations, and the Administration may accept or reject the submitted records, something entirely beyond Invoo's control.\n\nAdditionally, the Platform allows managing clients, products, and services, storing data and automating recurring information. It offers an expense recording system through uploading and classifying receipts or invoices, as well as exporting such data for gestorías. It also generates preliminary tax calculations such as estimates for models 130 or 303, although these calculations are merely indicative and do not constitute tax advice or a filed declaration.

The use of Invoo, including automated submission of Invoicing Records, does not exempt the User from the duty to review their invoices or verify the correct filing of their tax obligations.\n\nThe User must maintain adequate copies of their tax documentation and, when acting through a gestoría, verify that it has the necessary information to carry out its work. Invoo does not intervene in the relationship between the User and their gestoría and will not be responsible for errors, breaches, or negligence derived from such professional relationship.\n\nIt is prohibited to use the Platform for illegal, fraudulent activities or those that contravene current regulations, as well as to manipulate, distort, or attempt to breach its operation.

The Company may also carry out urgent actions when there are risks to data integrity, system security, or Service continuity.\n\nThe User accepts that not all incidents can be identified or resolved immediately, especially those related to elements external to the Company. In such cases, Invoo will act with the greatest possible diligence to restore normality and offer, within its possibilities, alternative solutions or updated information on the evolution of the incident.

The Platform does not replace the professional judgment of the User or their gestoría and does not guarantee the adequacy of information entered to applicable tax requirements in each case.\n\nNor will Invoo be responsible for penalties, surcharges, interest, or requirements that the Administration may impose on the User as a consequence of the content of their invoices, use of the Service, errors in transmitted data, or failure to timely comply with their legal obligations. It is up to the User to verify at all times that records have been generated and submitted correctly and that their tax situation is up to date.\n\nInvoo will not be liable for indirect damages, lost profits, loss of business opportunities, alterations in the User's activity, or any other economic damage that does not derive directly from a proven contractual breach attributable to the Company.

This limit will apply even if the User had contracted the Service for a shorter period.\n\nNone of the limitations provided for in this clause will affect liability that, imperatively, cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.\n\nThese limitations will apply regardless of the nature of the action exercised (contractual, extra-contractual, or any other type)."

After that period, Invoo will proceed to delete or block the information in accordance with its Privacy Policy and applicable retention obligations, especially in tax matters.

          "question": "What are the current VAT rates in Spain in 2026?",
          "answer": "In Spain there are four VAT rates: the standard 21% which applies to most products and services; the reduced 10% for food, transport and hospitality; the super-reduced 4% for essential products such as bread, milk and medicines; and 0% for exempt services such as healthcare and education."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "How do I calculate VAT for an invoice?",
          "answer": "To calculate VAT, multiply the base amount by the VAT rate divided by 100. For example, for a base of €100 with 21% VAT: 100 × 0.21 = €21 VAT. The invoice total would be €121. Our calculator does this calculation automatically."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "How do I extract VAT from a price that already includes it?",
          "answer": "To extract VAT from a final price, divide the total by 1 plus the VAT rate. For example, for a price of €121 with 21% VAT: 121 ÷ 1.21 = €100 base amount. The VAT would be €21. Select 'Extract VAT from total' in our calculator to perform this calculation."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What VAT should I apply to my services as a freelancer?",
          "answer": "Most professional services are taxed at 21% standard VAT. However, some services have reduced rates or are exempt. For example, healthcare services are exempt, as is regulated training. Consult with your accountant if you have doubts about your specific activity."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "When do I have to file quarterly VAT (form 303)?",
          "answer": "Freelancers and SMBs must file form 303 quarterly: by April 20 (Q1), July 20 (Q2), October 20 (Q3) and January 30 of the following year (Q4). In the form you declare the output VAT (charged) minus the input VAT (paid), and pay or offset the difference."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "What is input VAT and output VAT?",
          "answer": "Output VAT is what you charge your customers on your sales invoices. Input VAT is what you pay on invoices from your suppliers and deductible expenses. In the quarterly declaration, you subtract input from output: if the result is positive, you pay; if negative, you can offset or request a refund."

          "question": "How much does a self-employed person pay in 2026?",
          "answer": "It depends on your real income. With the 2026 bracket system, the minimum quota is €205/month for low income, and can reach up to €607/month for high income. New self-employed pay only €80/month with Flat Rate, or €0 with Zero Quota in some regions."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What is net income?",
          "answer": "It's the difference between your gross income and your deductible expenses (office rent, utilities, materials, insurance, etc.). Social Security uses your net income to determine your bracket and contribution base."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Can I change my contribution base?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can modify your contribution base up to 6 times per year through the RED system or your accountant. This allows you to adjust your quota if your income varies during the year."

        "q4": {
          "question": "What is annual regularization?",
          "answer": "At the end of the fiscal year, Social Security compares what you contributed with your actual income declared in your tax return. If you over-contributed, they refund the difference. If you under-contributed, you'll have to pay the difference."

          "question": "How do I apply for the Flat Rate?",
          "answer": "It's requested when registering as self-employed, by checking the option on form TA.0521. If you're already registered, you can request it as long as you meet the requirements (less than 12 months since registration)."

      "faq": {
        "q1": {
          "question": "How much income tax does a freelancer pay?",
          "answer": "It depends on your net income. With €30,000 net income and no special deductions, income tax is around €4,500-5,500 (effective rate ~15-18%). With dependent children or over 65, you pay less thanks to the minimums."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What are difficult-to-justify expenses?",
          "answer": "An automatic 5% deduction on net income (max €2,000/year) for freelancers in simplified direct estimation. Covers minor expenses without invoices. No need to justify them. Important: this deduction is incompatible with the reduction for economically dependent self-employed workers (TRADE)."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What expenses can I deduct as a freelancer?",
          "answer": "Deductible items include: social security quota, office rent, proportional utilities, materials and tools, training, insurance, accounting, advertising, business travel, meal allowances, and other business-related expenses."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What is the personal and family minimum?",
          "answer": "It's the portion of income exempt from taxation to cover basic needs. Personal minimum is €5,550 (€6,700 if 65+, €8,100 if 75+). For each child, between €2,400 and €4,500 is added."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "When should I use the 7% invoice withholding rate?",
          "answer": "The 7% rate is for new freelancers (registration year + following 2). If you expect low income, 7% may be enough. If you expect high income, 15% might be better to avoid paying a lot in your tax return."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "What's the difference between normal and simplified direct estimation?",
          "answer": "Simplified is for income < €600,000, allows basic accounting, and automatically deducts 5% of difficult-to-justify expenses. Normal requires full accounting but allows specific bad debt provisions."

          "answer": "With €30,000 annual billing and typical expenses of €3,000, an established freelancer would have a net salary of approximately €17,000-19,000 annually (~€1,500/month). A new freelancer with Flat Rate could reach €20,000-21,000 net thanks to quota savings."

          "question": "How is a freelancer's net salary calculated?",
          "answer": "Net salary = Billing - Deductible expenses - Freelancer quota - Income tax. First, subtract expenses from your billing to get net income. Then pay the freelancer quota based on your bracket. Finally, income tax is calculated on what's left minus personal deductions."

        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Is it worth increasing expenses to pay less tax?",
          "answer": "Only if they're real and necessary expenses for your activity. Every euro of deductible expense saves you between €0.19 and €0.47 in income tax (depending on your bracket). It doesn't make sense to spend €100 to save €25 in taxes. But you should ensure you include all legitimate expenses."

          "question": "How much do I save with the Flat Rate?",
          "answer": "The Flat Rate lets you pay only €80/month for the first 12 months (extendable to 24 if income is low). If your normal quota would be €300/month, you save €220/month × 12 = €2,640 the first year. It's significant savings for those starting out."

        "q1": {
          "question": "How much should I charge per hour as a freelancer?",
          "answer": "It depends on your sector, experience, and net salary goal. A junior developer might charge €30-50/h, while a senior can exceed €80-100/h. An experienced consultant or designer can bill between €60-150/h. Use this calculator by entering your desired net salary to get your optimal rate."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Why does my hourly rate need to be so high?",
          "answer": "As a freelancer, out of every euro you bill, you only take home 50-70 cents net. The rest goes to income tax (19-47%), social security (~€230-530/month in 2026), deductible expenses (20-40%), and non-billable time (vacation, administration, sales). That's why your hourly rate must be 2-3 times your desired 'hourly salary'. And no, it's not that you're charging too much: it's that being self-employed costs a lot."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "How many billable hours does a freelancer have per year?",
          "answer": "Typically between 1,200-1,600 hours annually. If you work 40h/week × 48 weeks (minus 4 vacation) = 1,920 total hours. But of those, 20-40% goes to non-billable tasks: administration, client acquisition, training, internal meetings. That's why 1,400-1,500 actual billable hours is common."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Should I include VAT in my hourly rate?",
          "answer": "No. VAT (generally 21%) is added to the final price but isn't your income—you must give it to the tax authorities. Your hourly rate should cover: your net salary + income tax + social security + expenses. VAT is separate and neutral (you collect it from clients and pay it to authorities, though you can deduct VAT from your expenses)."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "How do deductible expenses affect my rate?",
          "answer": "Expenses reduce your tax base, so you pay less income tax and social security. If you spend 20% of billing on deductible expenses, your tax burden will be lower than if you spend 0%. But be careful: spending just to spend isn't profitable. Only include real and necessary business expenses. This calculator accounts for that expense percentage."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Should my rate be the same for all projects?",
          "answer": "Not necessarily. You can have a base rate for standard projects and adjust based on: urgency (rush = more expensive), technical complexity, project duration (long contracts may get discounts), client type (large companies vs startups), exclusivity or required availability. The important thing is your weighted average rate covers your total costs."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "What if my clients say I'm too expensive?",
          "answer": "First, verify they're your target audience. If you bill B2B (companies), your €50-80/h rate is normal and profitable for them (you're saving them hiring a €40,000-50,000/year employee). Second, justify the value: don't sell 'hours', sell results. Instead of '€40/h', say 'this project will save you €X per year'. Third, if they still say it's expensive, they're not your client: find another one."
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "Does this calculator use correct 2026 Spanish tax data?",
          "answer": "Yes. We use current national income tax brackets (19-47% progressive), real income social security brackets per Royal Decree-law 13/2022, and the €5,550 personal allowance. Note that income tax may vary by Autonomous Community (±€500-2,000), and we don't include specific personal or family deductions."

The base amount can be deducted for IRPF if justified as a necessary business expense and doesn't exceed 1% of annual revenue. Always keep the invoice and note the business reason."

          "question": "From what income level is it worth creating an SL?",
          "answer": "There's no exact figure, it depends on your desired salary and expenses. As a general rule, with net profits (after expenses) above €40,000-50,000 annually, SL is usually more advantageous due to the differential between IRPF (up to 47%) and Corporate Tax (25%). Use the calculator with your real data to know for sure."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What is the 15% reduced Corporate Tax rate?",
          "answer": "If it's your first SL and you haven't been an administrator of another company in the last 5 years, you can apply 15% Corporate Tax (instead of 25%) during the first 2 fiscal years with profits, on the first €300,000. It's a tax advantage to encourage entrepreneurship."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "How much does it cost to create and maintain an SL?",
          "answer": "Creating an SL costs between €500-1,000 (notary, commercial registry). Annual maintenance includes accountant (€1,800-3,000/year), account filing, corporate tax. Fixed costs are significantly higher than as freelancer (accountant ~€600/year)."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Can I deduct more expenses in an SL than as freelancer?",
          "answer": "Not necessarily. Deductible expenses must be related to the activity in both cases. The difference is in how they're taxed: in SL you first pay Corporate Tax on company profit, then IRPF if you distribute dividends. Allows more flexibility in tax planning."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "What happens with Social Security in an SL?",
          "answer": "As SL administrator you contribute to General SS Regime, not as self-employed. Contributions are higher (company pays ~36%, you ~5% of gross salary), but in return you have better coverage (unemployment, work accidents). Total quota can exceed self-employed."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Can I switch from freelancer to SL without deregistering?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can create an SL and continue as freelancer temporarily to make the transition. Many entrepreneurs create the SL, gradually transfer the activity, then deregister as self-employed. You can also maintain both if you do different activities."
